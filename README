                Building and Installing Scandium
                ================================

Requirements
============
Building Scandium requires a few programs and libraries to be present.

Check to ensure the system provides the followings

    GNU make
    Both C and C++ compiler (e.g. gcc/g++ or related modules)

The build requires autotools scripts like,

    autoheader
    autoconf
    autoreconf

The following external libraries are needed for the Scandium installation
    libbz2
    libcrypto
    libcurl
    libdl
    liblzma
    libm
    libmysqlclient
    libpthread
    librt
    libssl
    libz

Building Configure
==================
Before the installation of Scandium, users need to first install htslib package.
https://github.com/samtools/htslib

Scandium has been tested against htslib from version 1.10 to 1.17.

Important Note:
htslib must be installed inside scandium directory. Please create a 'htslib' 
sub-directory like scandium/htslib if the 'htslib' sub-directory doesn't exist.
The 'htslib' sub-directory name should not include any version numbers.

Please follow the htslib 'INSTALL' instructions all the way to the final 
step 'make install' such as
    make prefix=<path to scandium/htslib directory> install

Once htslib is successfully installed, users can proceeds to build Scandium.
Please download any release package you prefer and decompress the package
    tar zxvf Scandium-release-version.tar.gz
    cd Scandium-release-version

Run the following to create a brand new configure for your system
    autoreconf -i

Once users have generated the configure file, then do the following
    ./configure --includedir=<path to mysql headers> LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L<path to libmysqlclient>"
    make
    make install

The './configure' generates Makefiles for the compilation.

The 'make' compiles source code in both src/ and uniformity_graph/
and generates executables.

The 'make install' command installs the compiled executables into the /usr/local
directory. Users can change the installation location by adding --prefix=DIR
option to the ./configure run or via 'make prefix=DIR install'.

NOTES
=====
In order to generate uniformity graph for each chromosome of your choice, 
please ensure your system has 'gnuplot' installed.
