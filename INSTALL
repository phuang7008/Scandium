System Requirements
===================
HTSlib depends on the following libraries:

    zlib       <http://zlib.net>
    libbz2     <http://bzip.org/>
    liblzma    <http://tukaani.org/xz/>
    libcurl    <https://curl.haxx.se/>
               (optional but strongly recommended, for network access)
    libcrypto  <https://www.openssl.org/>
               (optional, for Amazon S3 support; not needed on MacOS)
    libdeflate <https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate>
               (optional, but strongly recommended for faster gzip)

Scandium depends on the following libraries
    libdl    <https://packages.debian.org/sid/libc6-dev>
    libm     <https://hpc.llnl.gov/software/mathematical-software/libm>
    libmysqlclient      <https://cppget.org/libmysqlclient>
    libpthread          <https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/libpthread.html>
    librt    <https://sourceware.org/glibc/>
    libssl   <Not Needed Anymore>

The following programs are required:

    GNU make
    C compiler (e.g. gcc or clang)

In addition, building the configure script requires:

    autoheader
    autoreconf
    autoconf


Building Configure
==================
Before the installation of Scandium, users need to first install htslib package.
https://github.com/samtools/htslib

Scandium has been tested against htslib version 1.10, 1.15, 1.17 and v1.19. 
Note, please DO NOT use htslib v1.12 as it has bugs.

Important Note:
htslib must be installed inside scandium directory. Please create a 'htslib' 
sub-directory like scandium/htslib if the 'htslib' sub-directory doesn't exist.
The 'htslib' sub-directory name should not include any version numbers.

Please follow the htslib 'INSTALL' instructions all the way to the final 
step 'make install' such as
    make prefix=<path to scandium/htslib directory> install

Once htslib is successfully installed, users can proceeds to build Scandium.
Please download any release package you prefer and decompress the package
    tar zxvf Scandium-release-version.tar.gz
    cd Scandium-release-version

Run the following to create a brand new configure for your system
    autoreconf -i

Once users have generated the configure file, then do the following
    ./configure --includedir=<path to mysql headers> LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L<path to libmysqlclient>"
    make
    make install

The './configure' generates Makefiles for the compilation.

The 'make' compiles source code in both src/ and uniformity_graph/
and generates executables.

The 'make install' command installs the compiled executables into the /usr/local
directory. Users can change the installation location by adding --prefix=DIR
option to the ./configure run or via 'make prefix=DIR install'.

NOTES
=====
In order to generate uniformity graph for each chromosome of your choice, 
please ensure your system has 'gnuplot' installed. 

PERL
====
To generate gene annotation from the scripts provided, users need to have
MariaDB (mysql) database and DBD/mysql.pm module installed.

PYTHON
